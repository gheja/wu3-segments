An open source font based on the displays used on the U3 subway line in Vienna.

Download it here: https://github.com/gheja/wu3-segments/releases/

Note: this font is still work in progress.

## About

When I first visited Vienna and saw a display in the U3 subway and
immediately noticed how many segments there were. After thinking "this
must be way too many" I started to really like it and next time I took
a few pictures and [wanted to see all the characters](https://mastodon.social/@gheja/113012797551894562).
A bit later I [drew the segments in Inkscape](https://mastodon.social/@gheja/113138822732431374)
and played around with the idea of making a font out of it. It was
received surprisingly well on Mastodon, this gave me the push to
[really start to create the font](https://mastodon.social/@gheja/113215721872127696).

The name WU3 Segments comes from Wien U3 and the fact that it consists
of segments. I'm not really sure if it is used elsewhere as well but
I will stick with this name.

I probaly should write Wien Subway Font and Vienna U-Bahn Font here,
just for SEO reasons :)
